## Upload File to REST API with Sequelize and Express

This is demonstartion of File Upload eample to Rest Api using Express and Sequelize. I am using Multer which is a node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files. The uploaded form data is being stored to PostGres DB.

I have also included swagger-ui into the project and wrote the documentation manually.

Packages used in this example

    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "multer": "^1.4.2",
    "pg": "^7.12.1",
    "sequelize": "^5.15.1",
    "swagger-ui-dist": "^3.23.5",
    "swagger-ui-express": "^4.0.7"
